      Sam Mendes, the Oscar®-winning director of Skyfall, Spectre and American
      Beauty, brings his singular vision to his World War I epic, 1917. At the
      height of the First World War, two young British soldiers, Schofield
      (Captain Fantastic’s George MacKay) and Blake (Game of Thrones’
      Dean-Charles Chapman) are given a seemingly impossible mission. In a race
      against time, they must cross enemy territory and deliver a message that
      will stop a deadly attack on hundreds of soldiers—Blake’s own brother
      among them. 1917 is directed by Sam Mendes, who wrote the screenplay with
      Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Showtime’s Penny Dreadful). The film is produced by
      Mendes and Pippa Harris (co-executive producer, Revolutionary Road;
      executive producer, Away We Go) for their Neal Street Productions,
      Jayne-Ann Tenggren (co-producer, The Rhythm Section; associate producer,
      Spectre), Callum McDougall (executive producer, Mary Poppins Returns,
      Skyfall) and Brian Oliver (executive producer, Rocketman; Black Swan). The
      film is produced by Neal Street Productions for DreamWorks Pictures in
      association with New Republic Pictures. Universal Pictures will release
      the film domestically in limited release on December 25, 2019 and wide on
      January 10, 2020. Universal and Amblin Partners will distribute the film
      internationally, with eOne distributing on behalf of Amblin in the U.K.
